# Word-Ladders
Given two 5 letter words as an input the program will create a path between the words by changing only one letter at a time and keeping every change as an actual word. It takes in a very large dicitonary of 5 letter words as a reference. Achieves this with the use of linked lists and queues.

Main.cc contains all the contents of the code itself. The .txt file contains the dictonary of words that will be referenced.
